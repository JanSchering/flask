Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning (MARL) theory.

Information/Ideas from the
[MAS Foundation](http://masfoundations.org/) book ["Multiagent Systems
Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations"](http://masfoundations.org/)
will be used. For more technical and in-depth information on the theoretical concepts

## Introducing

After building a simple TRON game from scratch in JavaScript, a simple question is:
Can we build a CPU in order to create a single-player mode?

To achieve this

# NOTES

## Defining the game

Both players are self-interested with conflicting interests

==> can be modeled in normal form (game theory)

Example: the TCP game

Imagine scenario where two players can respectively decide between taking an action
A or B.

If:

- both choose A they will each get a reward of 3 points
- one chooses A while the other chooses B:
  - The one who chooses A gets 0 points
  - The one who chooses B gets 4 points
- both choose B, each player gets a reward of 1 point

==> Game theoretic answer:

- any rational agent chooses B, even if playing multiple times or being able to
  communicate with the other beforehand
- if the number of replays would be infinite they could maybe start adopting A

Strategic interactions between self-interested agents can be modeled in normal/strategic
form:

Represent each player's utility for every state of the world under the assumption
that the state only depends on the players' combined actions.

-> This is exactly the case that TRON presents us. The state is perfectly observable and
only depends on the actions of the players taken at each time step.

### Formal definition of a normal-form game explained:

A normal-form game is a Tuple (N, A, u), where:

- N is a finite set of N players indexed by i

==> in TRON we have 2 players, we can define N={n1, n2} where i=1,2

- A = A1 X ... X An where Ai is a finite set of actions available to player i

==> for our 2 players that means A={A1, A2} -> A1,A2={"LEFT", "RIGHT", "UP", "DOWN"}

- u = (u1, ..., un) where ui is a real-valued utility function for player i

==> we will need to get a utility function for each player

It is common to represent normal-form games in matrices (see Book chapter 3.4 for examples).
In the case of TRON, each player is represented through a 5x5 patch on a 1000x500 grid.
If we just look at a single player and leave out the movement history (blocks that are taken),
there are 1000/5=200 poisitons it could potentially be in for 500/5=100 rows. This amounts to
20,000 potential positions in which the player could take 4 potential actions. to display this in a table
we would thus need a 80,000x80,000 matrix.

### Strategies

- Select single action and play it (pure strategy)

- Randomizing over the set of possible actions according to a probability distribution
  (mixed strategy)
